# Bankruptcy Binary Classification

## Description of the Dataset
The Taiwanese Bankruptcy Prediction dataset, sourced from UC Irvineâ€™s Machine Learning Repository, contains 6,819 instances and 96 features. The dataset aims to predict the likelihood of a company going bankrupt based on various financial ratios and indicators.

## Comparison Performed
This comparison evaluates the performance of Lasso regression versus Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNNs) in binary classification. The focus is on metrics such as accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability.

## Summary of Code
The code in this folder implements Lasso regression and FCNN models for the bankruptcy prediction task. It includes preprocessing steps, model training, and evaluation using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and estimation time.

## Summary of Results
Lasso regression outperformed the FCNN model across all metrics, demonstrating its robustness in both regression and classification tasks. The results suggest that Lasso is particularly effective for financial predictions, where transparency and efficiency are essential.
